/*
** A little mandatory time to think was added when the number of
** philosophers is odd to avoid race conditions.
**
**	@arievs explains it very well:
**
** When there's an odd number of philosophers, we need to make sure the one
**	who didn't eat the longest manages to grab the forks instead of another one.
**	Imagine the following: there's 5 philosophers; 1 and 3 eat; 2 and 4 eat; 5 
**	and either 1 or 3 should start eating now, but instead 1 and 3 start eating
**	again and 5 starves. In order to avoid this, a small mandatory thinking time
**	was added when the number of philosophers is odd. In this way, the ones who
**	just finished sleeping and started thinking will be in disadvantage in
**	comparison to those who are thinking the longest (and thus not eating
**	the longest).
**
** BUT that only works in time_to_eat and time_to_sleep are the same. If 
**	time_to_sleep is significantly smaller, that small mandatory thinking time
**	won't make a difference. So if time_to_sleep is smaller than time_to_eat,
**	my philosophers need to think for the difference between the two plus that
**	small buffer.
